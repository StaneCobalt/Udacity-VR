# Udacity-VR
### by Stephen Sladek

This is a repo for my VR projects done through the Udacity VR Nanodegree. 
I'll post projects as they're completed as I'm still in progress on the nanodegree. 
All Term 1 and Term 2 projects have been built using the SDK for Google Cardboard and tested using a Samsung Galaxy S5 running API 19.

## Project Completed

### Term 1

- Carnival
	- Customized a prebuilt carnival scene to get familiar with the Unity Engine and C#.
- Apartment
	- Became more familiar with the lighting, animation and positioning components of Unity by creating an aprtment room.
- Maze
	- This project pulled everything together for Term 1. I did a lot of C# scripting, got experience with lighting optimization, and creating a waypoint system.

### Term 2

- Puzzler
	- This is actually just a really awesome version of Simon Says. I learned techniques for designing for VR experiences, user testing, iteration and documentation.
- Night at the Museum
	- Developed even more experience for VR design. Unlike the previous 4 projects that came with assets to work with, this project was completely done from scratch. I learned basic 3D modelling, and gained more VR design experience.

## Projects in Progress

### Term 3

- Rube Goldberg Game
	- Focuses on building a game for Desktop VR
- Performance Bounceback
	- Focuses on optimization
- Capstone
	- Brings it all together to create a custom VR experience
