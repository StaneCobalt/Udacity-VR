## Versions
- Unity 2017.2.0f3
- GVR Unity SDK v1.70.0

### Notes:
This project was built for Android and tested with a Samsung Galaxy S5.

I chose to leave the lightmaps uncompressed for this project since
1) Most people don't care much for blocky, pixelated lighting, and
2) The project is small enough that the hardware can handle it
